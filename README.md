# Clock_In_Flutter
### A flutter app to 'clock in' to work while working from home.


Working from home feels very different from working from a computer lab or an office. How long am I working? Has it been 20 minutes or 5 hours?
Personally, I work in multiple bursts all throughout a day, but how many productive hours am I actually putting into a day? The inibility to accurately keep track of my working hours makes all my time seem wasted, or like it's not enough. My solution: a way to 'clock in' when I start working, and 'clock out' when I take a break, storing all my times and giving me the total for my day.
